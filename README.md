# CL-VAE
Repository containing the code for the CL-VAE anomaly detection model as described in "Improved Anomaly Detection through Conditional Latent Space VAE Ensembles"


The code runs in three steps.

- Start by batch training models in the Model-Builder.ipynb notebook.
- Calculate AUCs based on ensemble sizes using the Model_Evaluate.ipynb notebook.
- Visualize the results in using the Model_Visualizer.ipynb notebook.
